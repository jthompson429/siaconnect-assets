Step 1: Open OneDrive Settings
	1.	Click the OneDrive icon in your Windows system tray (bottom-right corner).
	2.	Click the gear icon → choose Settings.


Step 2: Manage Synced Libraries
	1.	In the Settings window, go to the Account tab.
	2.	You’ll see a list of all synced libraries under “Locations syncing with OneDrive.”
	3.	Find the duplicate library you want to remove — it may have a number in parentheses (e.g., “Documents (1)”).


Step 3: Stop Syncing the Duplicate
	1.	Click Stop sync next to the duplicate library.
	2.	Confirm your choice when prompted.


Step 4: Delete the Local Folder
	1.	Open File Explorer.
	2.	Navigate to your OneDrive folder.
	3.	Delete the local folder for the duplicate library (e.g., “Documents (1)”).
	•	This only deletes the local copy — it does not delete files in SharePoint.
