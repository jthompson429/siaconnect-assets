Field Tech–Specific Value Adds You Might Consider

These are ideas that could make sense in SIAConnect over time, especially for field-facing roles:
	•	“Check weather for [city]” → Call a weather API and return the forecast (if allowed)
	•	“Where am I supposed to be today?” → Pull from service scheduling if integrated
	•	“Do I need to bring anything special for [model] repair?” → Pre-load common repair kits
	•	“What’s the weight of the CI-300X?” → Instant reference sheet response
	•	“Is [site] in a restricted area?” → Pull notes or travel safety tags
	•	“Can you explain this error code?” → Already part of your KB logic, but a big win
